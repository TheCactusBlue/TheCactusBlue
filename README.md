# CactusBlue

![github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=thecactusblue&theme=radical)

I'm currently building Mikoto Platforms, the knowledge-focused messaging platform. I usually work with Rust, TypeScript, React, and Kubernetes, but I try out new technologies for fun.

My personal obsessions include:

- social network designs
- intersection of anime and technology
- biohacking
- pl & compiler design
- financial systems
