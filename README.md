I am working for [Vizcom](https://vizcom.com), building AI tools for industrial designers (and more!). As a side project, I'm currently building [Mikoto Platforms](https://github.com/mikotoIO/mikoto), the world's first antisocial network. I usually work with Rust, TypeScript, React, and Kubernetes, but I try out new technologies for fun.

my personal obsessions include:

- social network designs
- intersection of anime and technology
- biohacking
- pl & compiler design
- financial systems

## Some of the tech I've used:
